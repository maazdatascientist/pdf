# PDF-TEXT-BASED-QA (https://mohammed-maaz-ahmed-pdf-text-based-qa-app-feature-branch-c7xmi0.streamlit.app/)  (https://huggingface.co/spaces/MohammedMaaz/PDF-TEXT-BASED-QA) 
This is a PDF and text-based question-answering system implemented using the Streamlit framework. The code allows users to upload a PDF file or enter text, then ask a question related to the content in the uploaded PDF file or entered text. 

model is fine tuned on squad dataset considering only 5000 examples and dividing them as 80 percent and 20 percent and freezing the base layer and saving the files of model and tokenizer in the local system and using them in the stramlit to deploy 

TO RUN THIS DEPLOYMENT FILE : save the file in .py fomat and run in cmd go to path where you have saved the file and type python app.py you will then have to type streamlit run app.py and it will direct your browswer to the webpage 

NOTE:- The fine tuning is present in the main branch and the application app.py and its requirements.txt and adiitional files such as logo and intoduction video are present and model and tokenizer files which are fine tuned are present in the feature-branchs

I have deployed this model on Streamlit cloud :-(https://mohammed-maaz-ahmed-pdf-text-based-qa-app-feature-branch-c7xmi0.streamlit.app/)
I have also deployed on Hugging face Spaces:-(https://huggingface.co/spaces/MohammedMaaz/PDF-TEXT-BASED-QA)
